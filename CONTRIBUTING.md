`docker-migrid` is a collaborative effort to streamline deployment of the `migrid` middleware on individual sites.
If you are interested we recommend trying it out for yourself as described in the [docs](https://docker-migrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
Feedback and actual code changes are also welcome once you start using the project code.

Feel free to open [Discussions](https://github.com/ucphhpc/docker-migrid/discussions) about specific topics and changes or make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ucphhpc/docker-migrid/pulls) with your suggested changes to support new features correct errors.
We will happily accept such improvements as long as they have been properly tested and don't interfere with other existing site deployments.
